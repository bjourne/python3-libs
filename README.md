# python3-libs

This repository contains Python code I have written. Originally, I
thought I should have repositories both for Python 2 and Python 3, but
since I only code in Python 3 nowadays, one repository was enough.

## Packages

Each package is in its own directory:

### ccrap

A work in progress C code generator for a concatenative language.

### learning

Modules for machine learning tasks.

### programs

Random programs.

### tools

Random modules.. Useful (I promise!) but random.

## Testing

Run the unit tests using:

    python3 -m pytest

## Installation

This code isn't meant to be installed. If you find some module you
like, just copy it.
